# Banana-Programming-Language
If the word "banana" doesn't show up enough in your code, it won't execute

you can do stuff like this

LET VAR = "BANANAs are yummy" <br />
LET N = 24 <br />
a = 0 <br />
b = 1 <br />
sum = 0 <br />
PRINT "Fib series: "<br />
FOR I = 0 TO 24  <br />
PRINT sum  <br />
PRINT " " <br />
a = b  <br />
b = sum  <br />
sum = a + b  <br />
NEXT <br />
PRINT DONE <br />
PRINT LINE <br />
