# Banana-Programming-Language
If the word "banana" doesn't show up enough in your code, it won't execute

you can do stuff like this

LET VAR = "BANANAs are yummy"
LET N = 24
a = 0
b = 1
sum = 0
PRINT "Fib series: "
FOR I = 0 TO 24 
PRINT sum 
PRINT " "
a = b 
b = sum 
sum = a + b 
NEXT
PRINT DONE
PRINT LINE
